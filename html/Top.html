<h3>All data from <a href="https://www.metal-archives.com/">THE Metal Archives</a>. Web page genereated with <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>.</h3>
<div>
<p>This page is about the so called top rated or highest reviewed albums by the MA users. They are really way too famous (and too mainstream for my taste) to make them a list. But anyway.</p>

<p><a href="#list">TL;DR. Go to the list</a>.</p>

<p>Trying to find the most favored album, I scraped 50000+ review pages across the site and analyzed them with statistical methods. The result? well that depends on how you evaluate the data. Models with different weight may lead to entirely different conclusions. Also the extremely small sample size of the reviews on an individual album and the heavily skewed distributions of the ratings in general can be limiting factors when applying statistical techniques. So I tend not to offer ONE definite album name. <s>But it's not Hades Archer's <a href="https://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Hades_Archer/Penis_Metal/213978">Penis Metal</a> at least. </s></p>
<p>
3 parts of work I've done: </p>
<p>- Fetching the data from the review pages, building a dataset and applying "comparing mean techniques" (pairwise Mann Whitney U Test principally) on the data in order to rank the reviewed albums and make a top list out of them (see the list at the bottom of the page). </p>

<p>- Word mining based on the top list dataset, which can be seen as a subset of all data I get, in order to see how the most popular albums have been reviewed exactly.</p>
<p>- Sampling the top list dataset further in order to visualize them.</p>
<p>
But stuff I write here will not be confined to this order. The analysis details that I used to select and rank the albums will (possibly) be added later, if I can somehow motivate myself to write about that..</p>

<p>The bubble chart shows how a random sample of reviewers (sample size = 2000) rate the albums through time. The plot sizes indicate the number of words in an individual review, while the colors differentiate the bands’ country of origin (European-red, American-black, Oceanian-beige,  Asian-lila, in descending order of the number).</p>
<p>It seems the users really like to heap their reviews on the top. Even i tried so hard to adjust the parameters, the plots still overlap heavily. Understandable though. We might get more motivated to write a review about the albums we like than about stuff that we find generic after all.</p>

<p>Death metal and black metal turn out to be our favorite. Since I just keep the "genre" as it is, you might notice "Death Metal" and "Melodic Death Metal" are counted as two genres here. It's safe to say the number will rise if I merge these subgenres like “Brutal”, “Post-”, “Atmospheric” and this or that or whatever, let alone there are quite a few bands whose genre are something like "Trve Black Metal (early); Folk/Dark Basement Ambient (mid); Extreme Experimental Punk/Disco (later)".</p>

<h4>What are the most “controversial” albums?</h4>
<p>To examnie how the opinion diverges on a certain album, you should look at the the sd value (standard deviantion) of the ratings. “In statistics, the standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values,” as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a> puts it. “A low sd indicates that the values tend to be close to the the expected value of the set, while a high sd indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range” bla bla… Based on this concept, a high sd can probably be a sign of dissension within the reviewers, although the album they reviewed may have relatively high rating on average.</p>

<b>Updated:</b> someone criticized me because the list didn't (and still doesn't) include blabla band's blabla album. i think I've already explained this list was generated based on MA users' reviews? The results are perhaps biased, but they don't represent my own taste. Can't you see my favorite albums ain't on the list either? And can't you see how scarce the reviews are on the site? Instead of blaming it on my "useless statistics" I think it's better to log yourself in on MA and write as many reviews as possible in all your free time. 🤷
<br>Anyway, you can still use the list to check out old/famous stuff you'd possibly like but somehow missed.
<br>Other suggestions like to categorize the list based on time and regions are under consideration and might be added later.<br><b>Updated[2]:</b> filters added. 
</p>
<p id="update-info"><b>Updated[3]:</b> 
New approach to rank the album adjusted for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cohort effect</a> (time period), which will give relatively more weight to later albums that have high ratings but comparatively fewer reviews . <br>
Previously the unadjusted lists are predisposed in favor of albums with more reviews, which makes less sense when comparing albums widely separated in release dates, since the amount of reviews naturally accumulated over time. <br>
The new algorithm attempts to compensate this structural influence, but to be honest the issue is all too complicated, given that many factors such as the growth of MA users, the increase in marketing hype by some labels, or the decline of interests in irrelevant (old) releases might also have an impact on the number of reviewers sharing their idea. <br>
Which way will be better? Who knows. Perhaps I should not be so serious because MA reviews are criminally arbitrary......<br> 
Also some other small changes that are not worth explaining.
